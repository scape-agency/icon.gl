**`icon.gl` is an inspired icon library based on the traditional Kaidā glyphs used historically in the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. These glyphs, rooted in local administration and communication, encompass a variety of symbols representing animals, plants, numerals, and household items.**

## Introduction

Icon.gl is a modern, innovative icon library infused with the essence of traditional [Kaidā glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaid%C4%81_glyphs), echoing the historical charm of the Yaeyama Islands. Our design principles revolve around simplicity, modernity, and a touch of quirkiness. Each icon is distilled to its fundamental form, ensuring it embodies only the most essential characteristics. With bold geometric shapes, our icons boast a symmetrical and consistent look, providing unparalleled clarity and readability even at smaller sizes. This unique blend of contemporary design and cultural heritage makes icon.gl not just a collection of symbols, but a storytelling tool that bridges the past with the present.

## Design principles

### Concept

`icon.gl` icons are designed to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics.

## Features

- Diverse Range: Includes icons representing a broad spectrum of elements from nature, agriculture, and domestic life.
- Cultural Heritage: Reflects the rich historical context of the Yaeyama Islands.
- Numerical Symbols: Incorporates unique numeral systems, influenced by Suzhou numerals.

## Specifications







### Keyline Shapes

The icon grid serves as a fundamental framework, setting forth definitive yet adaptable guidelines for the placement of graphic elements. At the core of this grid lie the keyline shapes, which form the foundational structure. Adhering to these keyline shapes as guiding principles ensures that system icons maintain consistent visual proportions, creating a harmonious and unified visual language. This approach not only fosters consistency across various icons but also allows for flexibility in their design, ensuring both uniformity and creative versatility.

### Icon sizes

`icon.gl` icons are displayed as 24 x 24 dp. Create icons for viewing at 100% scale for pixel-perfect accuracy.

#### Dense layouts

On desktop, when the mouse and keyboard are the primary input methods, measurements may be scaled down to 20dp.

## Usage

Ideal for projects seeking a blend of historical and cultural aesthetics with functional iconography.

Iconography is highly functional in a user interface. When used wisely, icons become an elegant yet efficient way to communicate with and help guide a user through an experience. To maintain this functionality, it’s important to reduce cognitive load on users by employing icons sparingly and strategically throughout your designs.

#### Sizing

Icons have been designed to work best in four sizes: 16px, 20px, 24px, and 32px. Please use icons at their originally produced size. These are provided in SVG and Adobe Illustrator files.

## Installation

Instructions on how to integrate icon.gl into your project.

``` sh
npm i icon.gl
```

## Template

Create your own system and product icons with these Adobe Illustrator files including the 24dp icon grid.

### Template Setttings

#### Layout

Icon content should remain inside of the **live area**, which is the region of an image that is unlikely to be hidden from view (such as when sidebars appear upon scrolling).

If additional visual weight is needed, content may extend into the padding between the live area and the **trim area** (the complete size of a graphic). No parts of the icon should extend outside of the trim area.

##### Live area

Icon content is limited to the 20dp x 20dp live area, with 2dp of padding around the perimeter.

##### Padding

2dp of padding surrounds the live area.

#### Units

- General: Pixels
- Stroke: Pixels
