**`icon.gl` is an inspired icon library based on the traditional Kaidā glyphs used historically in the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. These glyphs, rooted in local administration and communication, encompass a variety of symbols representing animals, plants, numerals, and household items.**

## Introduction

Icon.gl is a modern, innovative icon library infused with the essence of traditional Kaidā glyphs, echoing the historical charm of the Yaeyama Islands. Our design principles revolve around simplicity, modernity, and a touch of quirkiness. Each icon is distilled to its fundamental form, ensuring it embodies only the most essential characteristics. With bold geometric shapes, our icons boast a symmetrical and consistent look, providing unparalleled clarity and readability even at smaller sizes. This unique blend of contemporary design and cultural heritage makes icon.gl not just a collection of symbols, but a storytelling tool that bridges the past with the present.

## Design principles

### Concept

System icons are designed to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics.

Icon shapes are bold and geometric. They have a symmetrical and consistent look, ensuring readability and clarity, even at small sizes.

### Grid and keyline shapes

#### Icon design templates

Create your own system and product icons with these Adobe Illustrator files including the 24dp icon grid.

Available under Apache 2.0. By downloading this file, you agree to the Google Terms of Service. The Google Privacy Policy describes how data is handled in this service.

### Icon sizes

System icons are displayed as 24 x 24 dp. Create icons for viewing at 100% scale for pixel-perfect accuracy.

#### Dense layouts

On desktop, when the mouse and keyboard are the primary input methods, measurements may be scaled down to 20dp.

### Layout

Icon content should remain inside of the **live area**, which is the region of an image that is unlikely to be hidden from view (such as when sidebars appear upon scrolling).

If additional visual weight is needed, content may extend into the padding between the live area and the **trim area** (the complete size of a graphic). No parts of the icon should extend outside of the trim area.

Live area
Icon content is limited to the 20dp x 20dp live area, with 2dp of padding around the perimeter.

Padding
2dp of padding surrounds the live area.
