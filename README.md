2. **Medium (20px):** A slightly larger variant, offering a balance between visibility and space efficiency. This size is versatile, suitable for a variety of digital mediums including web interfaces, mobile apps, and interactive displays.

3. **Standard (24px):** This is the default size, optimized for the majority of use cases. It strikes an ideal balance between prominence and subtlety, ensuring readability without overwhelming the user interface.

4. **Large (32px):** Designed for situations where icons need to be more prominent. This size is particularly effective in desktop applications, interactive kiosks, or any interface where icons serve as primary navigation or interaction elements.

## File Formats and Accessibility

Each icon size is provided in both SVG and Adobe Illustrator file formats. SVGs offer scalability and flexibility, perfect for responsive web design and applications where file size and load times are critical. Adobe Illustrator files provide a vector-based format for high-fidelity editing, allowing designers to customize icons to fit their specific project needs.

- **SVGs:** These are ideal for web use, ensuring that icons scale perfectly across different screen resolutions and sizes. SVGs also support modifications and animations, making them highly adaptable.

- **Responsive Design:** Icons are crafted to be responsive, ensuring they maintain their integrity and legibility across different devices and screen sizes.

## Best Practices

### Color

Icons are always a solid, monochromatic color and need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography (4.5:1). The color of the icon should reflect the importance of the icon’s action which should always be to help guide a user. For more information on color, see Color in UI.

#### Dense layouts

On desktop, when the mouse and keyboard are the primary input methods, measurements may be scaled down to 20dp.

## Usage

Ideal for projects seeking a blend of historical and cultural aesthetics with functional iconography.

Iconography is highly functional in a user interface. When used wisely, icons become an elegant yet efficient way to communicate with and help guide a user through an experience. To maintain this functionality, it’s important to reduce cognitive load on users by employing icons sparingly and strategically throughout your designs.
