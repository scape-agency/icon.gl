# Icon Scaling

It is highly recommended to use the icons at their originally produced sizes. Scaling icons beyond their intended size can lead to a loss of detail or clarity. However, for specialized cases where custom sizes are needed, SVG format should be used to ensure that icons scale properly without quality degradation.

To cater to diverse design needs, `icon.gl` icons are meticulously crafted in four primary sizes:

1. **Small (16px):** Ideal for compact interfaces or where space is at a premium. These icons maintain their distinctiveness even at reduced scales, making them perfect for mobile applications or intricate web elements.

2. **Medium (20px):** A slightly larger variant, offering a balance between visibility and space efficiency. This size is versatile, suitable for a variety of digital mediums including web interfaces, mobile apps, and interactive displays.

3. **Standard (24px):** This is the default size, optimized for the majority of use cases. It strikes an ideal balance between prominence and subtlety, ensuring readability without overwhelming the user interface.

4. **Large (32px):** Designed for situations where icons need to be more prominent. This size is particularly effective in desktop applications, interactive kiosks, or any interface where icons serve as primary navigation or interaction elements.

## File Formats and Accessibility

Each icon size is provided in both SVG and Adobe Illustrator file formats. SVGs offer scalability and flexibility, perfect for responsive web design and applications where file size and load times are critical. Adobe Illustrator files provide a vector-based format for high-fidelity editing, allowing designers to customize icons to fit their specific project needs.

- **SVGs:** These are ideal for web use, ensuring that icons scale perfectly across different screen resolutions and sizes. SVGs also support modifications and animations, making them highly adaptable.

- **Responsive Design:** Icons are crafted to be responsive, ensuring they maintain their integrity and legibility across different devices and screen sizes.
