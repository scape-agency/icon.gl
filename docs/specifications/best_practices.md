# Best Practices

## Color

Icons are always a solid, monochromatic color and need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography (4.5:1). The color of the icon should reflect the importance of the iconâ€™s action which should always be to help guide a user. For more information on color, see Color in UI.

## Dense layouts

On desktop, when the mouse and keyboard are the primary input methods, measurements may be scaled down to 20dp.
